abstract = {The petroleum geology of the Mississippi Canyon, Atwater Valley, western DeSoto Canyon, and western Lloyd Ridge protraction areas, offshore northern Gulf of Mexico, is controlled by the interaction of salt tectonics and high sedimentation rate during the Neogene and resulted in a complex distribution of reservoirs and traps. We evaluate 87 fields and discoveries: 51 with combined structural/stratigraphic traps (three-way closures), 19 with structural traps (four-way closures), and 17 with stratigraphic traps. Three of these discoveries are in Upper Jurassic eolian reservoirs; the remaining discoveries are in Neogene deep-water reservoirs. The tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the area is analyzed at 11 discrete intervals between 24 Ma and the present. Four stratigraphic external forms-troughs, bowls, wedges, and sheets-are integrated with the structural geology to understand the changing shape of subbasins and minibasins, primarily in a slope setting. This analysis shows how the allochthonous salt systems evolved over time and how salt movement affected sedimentation patterns and subbasin evolution.The study area includes some of the largest fields in the northern deep-water Gulf of Mexico, such as the Thunder Horse field, which produces from an anticlinal (turtle) structure, or the Mars-Ursa and associated fields with greater than 1.5 billion BOE estimated ultimate recovery, which developed with a counterregional allochthonous salt system. The remaining fields have considerably smaller reserves, which are controlled by the area within closure and the number of reservoir intervals.Most of fields in the study area are contained within sheet-shaped or wedge-shaped stratigraphic external forms and have four-way or three-way trapping configurations. These findings indicate the profound effect of mobile salt on the petroleum geology of the region.},

@article{Zeng,
abstract = {We discuss, in a two-part article, the benefits of 90째-phase wavelets in stratigraphic and lithologic interpretation of seismically thin beds. In Part 1, seismic models of Ricker wavelets with selected phases are constructed to assess interpretability of composite waveforms in increasingly complex geologic settings. Although superior for single surface and thick-layer interpretation, zero-phase seismic data are not optimal for interpreting beds thinner than a wavelength because their antisymmetric thin-bed responses tie to the reflectivity series rather than to impedance logs. Nonsymmetrical wavelets (e.g., minimum-phase wavelets) are generally not recommended for interpretation because their asymmetric composite waveforms have large side lobes. Integrated zero-phase traces are also less desirable because they lose high-frequency components in the integration process. However, the application of 90째-phase data consistently improves seismic interpretability. The unique symmetry of 90째-phase thin-bed response eliminates the dual polarity of thin-bed responses, resulting in better imagery of thin-bed geometry, impedance profiles, lithology, and stratigraphy. Less amplitude distortion and less stratigraphy-independent, thin-bed interference lead to more accurate acoustic impedance estimation from amplitude data and a better tie of seismic traces to lithology-indicative wireline logs. Field data applications are presented in part 2 of this article.},

abstract = {Understanding the properties of a reservoir's fluids and creating a successful model based on lab data and calculation are required for every reservoir engineer in oil and gas today, and with reservoirs becoming more complex, engineers and managers are back to reinforcing the fundamentals. PVT (pressure-volume-temperature) reports are one way to achieve better parameters, and Equations of State and PVT Analysis, 2nd Edition, helps engineers to fine tune their reservoir problem-solving skills and achieve better modeling and maximum asset development. Designed for training sessions for new and existing engineers, Equations of State and PVT Analysis, 2nd Edition, will prepare reservoir engineers for complex hydrocarbon and natural gas systems with more sophisticated EOS models, correlations and examples from the hottest locations around the world such as the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and China, and Q\&A at the end of each chapter. Resources are maximized with this must-have reference.
Improve with new material on practical applications, lab analysis, and real-world sampling from wells to gain better understanding of PVT properties for crude and natural gasSharpen your reservoir models with added content on how to tune EOS parameters accuratelySolve more unconventional problems with field examples on phase behavior characteristics of shale and heavy oil},
